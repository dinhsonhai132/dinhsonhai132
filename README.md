# 👋 Hi, I'm Sơn Hải 👨‍💻 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72663882/171687151-bb31c996-c9d2-49c8-b593-734946893b23.gif" alt="waving hand gif" aria-hidden="true" width="40" />

I'm a final-year high school student from Vietnam 🇻🇳

I’m passionate about programming, especially **low-level** topics like **C**, **Assembly**, and **building programming languages from scratch**.

> I don’t just want to learn how to *use* a language,
> I want to understand **what the computer is actually doing underneath**.

## 🧠 What am I working on?

* 🔧 Building **Suny** — a programming language written in **pure C**
* 🧩 Studying:

  * Interpreters / Virtual Machines
  * AST & bytecode
  * Memory management, Garbage Collection
  * Runtime internals
* ✍️ Writing code to **understand**, not just to make it run

---

## 🚀 Vision

* Building **Solarity Labs** — an independent technology company
* Developing software focused on:

  * system-level foundations
  * programming languages & runtimes
  * tools that help developers understand and control the machine
* Creating products that **don’t chase trends**, but are technically solid and long-lasting
